Web scraping: Artists announcements
-Add functionalities: announcement dates, "announcer"
-locations? ()

After this: Go through all artists and gather their exhibitions

Web scraping: Text from announcements

-Get info from announcements themselves
-Potentially use some more complicated methods for every announcement

Other:

Do a minimal working example e.g. with just the contemporary artists (don't need to use Selenium)
Artist gathering: maybe also extract how many announcements each artist has (not sure if we need it now and because we use multiple )
