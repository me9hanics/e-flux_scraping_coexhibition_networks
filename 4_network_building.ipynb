We then created two smaller networks: one where two artists are only connected if they share two common exhibitions (this network was in the end not analyzed) and one where only a subset of artist are included, who are in [PainterPalette](https://github.com/me9hanics/PainterPalette). This is be described more in the `5_community_detection.ipynb` notebook."
